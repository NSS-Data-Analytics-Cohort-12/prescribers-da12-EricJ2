QUESTION MATERIAL: wrong:
select sum(prescription.total_claim_count) as total_claims, prescriber.specialty_description
from prescription
left join prescriber
	on prescriber.npi= prescription.npi
group by prescription.total_claim_count, prescriber.specialty_description
order by prescription.total_claim_count desc
limit 1;

correct with join, inner join, and right join:
select prescriber.specialty_description, sum(prescription.total_claim_count) as total_claims
from prescriber
right join prescription on prescriber.npi = prescription.npi
group by prescriber.specialty_description
order by total_claims desc
LIMIT 1;
